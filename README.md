# Storm Viewer
This an iPhone iOS app that loads pictures, presents them in an interactive list, and allows the user to choose pictures, and view them in full screen.  
Pictures used are from the National Severe Storms Laboratory.  
I have implemented the following functionality in the project:
- View Controllers, with multiple views, and connected via user input, allowing moving to navigating back and forwards.
- File Manager, to read files from the phone, and retrive them.
- Table View, with reusable cells.
- UI images, displays, and text.

## Setup
The UI is built through code, the detailView requires linking an image view to the correct variable in the detailViewController. Cells must have a template and be tagged to be used in the code.  
Code does not include neccessary xcode setup files, which can be created when starting a new project in xcode.

The project was created for the course at: www.hackingwithswift.com
